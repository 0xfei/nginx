Stage 1:
nginx provide basic data structure and algorithms. Stage 1 just read these files, and mark them. Besides, process of how nginx work is basicly clear.

Stage 2:
As stage 1 says, i should be more clear. So this stage, we read nginx.c and the main function, and mark of event module should be done.

Good, seems this stage has been compeleted.

Stage 3:
1. http, upstream modules
2. execute nginx and debug it
3. write my own modules
